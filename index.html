      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Honors.
         I have been a percussion instructor for the past eight years, but have recently
         started a new journey into software development! 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've moved quite a lot. I was born in Rochester NY, moved to South Carolina 
         for a few years. I then moved to Southern California to start college before 
         transferring to Northern California to finish my degree at UCB.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing table tennis, board games, and hanging out with friends!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At the moment, it is to be a front-end developer/designer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in San Jose, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in a career in web development because I enjoy problem solving
         through creative means. I think it'll be challenging to start, but I look forward
         to learning as much as I can!
